# Diabetes-Management-Application

The aim of this project is to design and prototype a mobile health (mHealth) application to support individuals with type 2 diabetes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The app will focus on improving blood sugar control, medication adherence, and digital literacy, especially for middle-aged users with limited experience using mobile technology. The system will be multilingual, lightweight, and capable of functioning offline.
